                <h2> Hello! Welcome to my website! I coded this website for my COMM 150 Intro to New Media class! I have coded in html 
                    before for a previous classs. However, this was my first time using CSS and stylesheets so intensivley. It was frustrating at 
                    first. I didn't know how things like containers aworked and formatting was annoying. Howevever, once I watched a few videos
                    I go the hang of it (somewhat). Now I am so happy with how it turned out! I am really proud of myself because although it was hard,
                    I didn't give up on the vision I wanted! I like coding in html and can definitley see myself continuing making projects in the future for fun!

                </h2> <br>
                <h2> I definitley want to work on projects like this in the future! I had so much fun and I wish I had more time to work on this! Maybe I will get to 
                    update it in the future when things are less stressfull and add more elements I wanted to! I will probably try to take a class on web design in the 
                    future! :3
