                        <h1> 9-1-1 </h1>
                        <p> Zyah: This is my ultimate comfort show, even though it involves numerous traumatic events!
                            I love all the characters and have probab;y watched this show 4 times w/ diff people! 4.5/5 stars
                        </p> 
                        <p> Olivia: 9-1-1 is a necessary corny tv show w/ a comedic twist to serious events. 4.5/5 stars</p>
                        <p>Isha: I thought it was interesting to watch as an EMT some of the procedures and reactions taht they
                            showed were definitley not accurate, but it was still entertaining nonetheless! 3.5/5 stars
                        </p>
                        <p> Julia: I thought 9-1-1 was extremely riveting. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The part where the guy almost 
                            blew up was crazy (tbh this happens like every other 9-1-1 ep lol so idek what ep she's talking about)
                            I liked the drama but it was a little too stressfull for me. Overall it was a good watch though! 3.5/5 stars.
                        </p>

                        <h1> High School Musical the Musical the Series</h1>
                        <p> Zyah: Another one of my comfort shows! I started it when I was 15/16 and I live for juicy cheesy drama and relationship conflict!
                            I remember watching it live and being so invested in it. I've also probably seen the show like 3 times watching it with other people. 
                            I also legitimatley cried at the end it was sooo good! I love the music and the cast is so talented. I love the character Gina and her 
                            actress Sofia Wylie. Def a 4/5 stars!!!
                        </p>
                        <p> Isha: I had no idea what was going on tbh there's so many side arcs and plot twists, but to be fair, I started watching it midway at random
                            points so I'm probably not the best choice for a review, but... I LOVE LOVE LOVED the songs they were so catchy! 3/10 Stars
                        </p>
                        <p> Azreen: I really liked the soundtrack. I also liked how the characters and the actors grew in both their vocals and acting skills. 
                            I don't like one character in particular, but everyone else is flawed but relatably so. It has its very cringey moments, but the really good moments balance
                            it out. 4/5 stars.
                        </p>
                        <p> Julia: This is a fun show! I really enjoyed all the songs! Also love Sofia Wylie and Olivia Rodrigo. 4/5 stars.
